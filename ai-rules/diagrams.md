# Diagrams Rules

## Default position
- Prefer text over diagrams.

## If a diagram is required
- Keep it strictly business-level (people, process, decisions, timelines).
- Do not depict systems, components, integrations, data flows, or technical structures.
- Keep labels plain-language and stakeholder-friendly.

## Formatting
- Use Markdown only.
- If using ASCII diagrams, keep them simple and readable.
