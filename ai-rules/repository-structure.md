# Repository Structure Rules

## Non-negotiables
- This repository is used exclusively for presales documentation.
- Markdown files only (`.md`).
- Content is business-only and written for non-technical stakeholders.

## Allowed folders
- `docs/narrative/` for the client-facing presales story in numbered order.
- `docs/working/` for internal, non-linear working notes.
- `ai-rules/` for AI governance rules.
- `.github/` for templates (as applicable).

## File naming and stability
- Do not rename, remove, merge, or add files beyond the agreed structure.
- Keep `docs/narrative/` numbering and order unchanged.
